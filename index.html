        <h1><b>Note:</b> The Project Flawless website is under development. Check back soon!</h1>
        <p>In the meantime, you can join the Project Flawless Discord server to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hang out with the community by sharing your interests</li>
            <li>Build a bond between friends, old and new</li>
            <li>Discuss Tamer's content such as his My Little Pony and Sonic Underground series</li>
            <li>Watch videos in VC, including MLP, Tamers, movies, etc.</li>
            <li>Play video games with people, including joining our newly made Minecraft server.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Love</em> Flawless Sparklemoon</strong></li>
            <li>Share your art, programming, music, and anything you made</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By the way, you should check out the new Minecraft server we made! It's still hosted in a free service named Aternos, so would find any donation means so that we can fund the server costs!</p>
        <p>To join the Minecraft server, reply in the #requests channel in the Discord server with your Minecraft <strong>Java</strong> username, not Bedrock. <em>(we will make an option for Bedrock users to join via GeyserMC server plugin for crossplay after we move the server to a paid solution.)</em></p>

        <p>Shoutout to the one and only <a href="https://x.com/TheTamers12345/status/1892486601785085998">@TheTamers12345!</a></p>
        <p>We feel overwhelmed and happy that you acknowledged our community's efforts!</p>
